      <p>
        This is the second lab assignment and I already learned so much.
        It looked really complicated when I was reading all the new tags, 
        but once I got to practice it I am actually having a lot of fun with it. 
        I think the way the professor is teaching it online with all the links 
        to dive deeper in the reading material is making it so much easier to learn it. 
        So far I'm loving this class.

    <div class="column" id="section2">
      <h2>Blog Post 2</h2>
      <p>
        I learned how to make an external CSS file, adding colors to words, 
        changing fonts, spacing, background colors, and changing letter sizes. 
        Learning how to make a website and then learning how to add links was exciting. 
        I’m excited for what else we will learn.

    <div class="column" id="section3">
      <h2>Blog Post 3</h2>
      <p>
        In this lab assignment I learned how to make a website functional on a laptop, tablet and on a phone. 
        I also learned how to add links to skip to different parts of the page.
